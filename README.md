## Sample WebRTC App - Getting Started

A single static page app so that we can easily understand how to use the WebRTC API to establish communication between two peers.

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can check by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.

**Additional notes:**

  1. This is a basic example and does not implement security features like encryption.
  2. You may need to allow camera and microphone access in your browser settings for the video call to function properly.
